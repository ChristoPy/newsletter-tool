# Newslleter Tool
The __BrazilJS Weekly Newsletter__ is one of the best Brazilian resources to keep up-to-date with technology in general, specially Web Technologies.  
Every week, more than 15,000 developers get the latest and more relevant news, tools, articles, etc.  
BrazilJS crew is responsible for the curatorship and review, but the main content feed come from the community.  
Everything is done in our [BrazilJS Weekly repository](https://github.com/braziljs/weekly), where people can share all kinds of content.  
After that, it's time to filter what is going to be listed in our newsletter by reading the content and validating every single suggestion.  
That's our secret, we do love to be up-to-date and we care about great content, so we make sure that every sent email is carefully handcrafted by our editors.  
That's a hard but necessary work.  
However, that's a lot of steps in this process which can be automated, and with that in mind, we created this tool.  

The `newsletter-tool` aims to help BrazilJS' editors.  
Here are some key steps done every single week to build our beloved newsletter:

- Create a new campaign (normally a copy of the last one) on [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)(the service we use to create and send the newsletter)  
- Sort in categories (normally *news*, *articles*, *tools* and *others*)  
- Sort the content by relevance  
- Insert each link on the campaign email template 
- Review

That's just the main steps ðŸ˜“  
As we have a video version of the newsletter ([BrazilJS Weekly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/braziljs)) and a text version on [BrazilJS' portal](https://braziljs.org/), which one with a different approach, you can see that's a lot of work.
